# most-starred
This is a small webapp that lists the most starred github repos that were created in the last 30 days.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js.
```
Vue was used in this project because it is samll and suitable for small webapps, but also flexible and scalable with tons of liberaries and its powerful CLI and active community which makes it appealing for bigger scale projects as well.

It is also small in size, so quicker to load and uses less bandwidth.
